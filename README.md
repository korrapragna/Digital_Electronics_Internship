# What is digital electronics?
Digital electronics is a branch of electronics that deals with systems that use discrete (distinct) signal levels, typically represented by binary numbers — 0 and 1. Unlike analog electronics, where signals can vary smoothly across a range of values, digital electronics processes information using only two states (usually referred to as LOW and HIGH, or OFF and ON).

0 → low voltage

1 → high voltage
